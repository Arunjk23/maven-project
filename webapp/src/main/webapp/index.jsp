<h1> COPA - Azure DevOps POC </h1>

<h3>CI and CD are two acronyms frequently used in modern development practices and DevOps. </h3>
<h3> This is to demo the implementation of CI/CD pipeline through Azure Devops </h3>

<p>Continuous integration (CI) is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run</p>
<p>Continuous Delivery (CD) is the process to build, test, configure and deploy from a build to a production environment. </p>

<h3>Azure DevOps tools used in the POC:</h3>
<p> Azure App Services - to host the webapp in Azure cloud </p>
<p> Pipelines  - to automate build/test/deployments of code</p>
<p> Repos - used for selenium code (can use GitHub instead)</p>
